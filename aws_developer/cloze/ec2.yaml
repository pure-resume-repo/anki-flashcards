"EC2 1": "{{c1::EC2 instances}} can be {{c1::optimized}} for different {{c1::use cases}}, with a naming convention like {{c1::m5.2xlarge}}: '{{c1::m}}' for instance class, '{{c1::5}}' for generation, and '{{c1::2xlarge}}' for size within the class."
"EC2 2": "Ideal for {{c1::diverse workloads}} such as {{c1::web servers}} or {{c1::code repositories}}. They offer a balance between {{c1::compute}}, {{c1::memory}}, and {{c1::networking}}. The {{c1::t2.micro}} is an example of a General Purpose EC2 instance."
"EC2 3": "Suitable for {{c1::compute-intensive tasks}} that require {{c1::high-performance processors}}, like {{c1::batch processing}}, {{c1::media transcoding}}, and {{c1::high-performance computing (HPC)}}, {{c1::scientific modeling}}, {{c1::machine learning}}, and {{c1::dedicated gaming servers}}."
"EC2 4": "Provide {{c1::fast performance}} for workloads that process large data sets in {{c1::memory}}, such as {{c1::high-performance relational/non-relational databases}}, distributed web scale cache stores, in-memory databases optimized for BI, and applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data."
"EC2 5": "Designed for {{c1::storage-intensive tasks}} that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on {{c1::local storage}}, suitable for {{c1::OLTP systems}}, relational & NoSQL databases, cache for in-memory databases (e.g., {{c1::Redis}}), data warehousing applications, and distributed file systems."
"EC2 6": "Security groups act as {{c1::virtual firewalls}} for EC2 instances, controlling both {{c1::inbound}} and {{c1::outbound traffic}}. They can be attached to multiple instances, are specific to a {{c1::region/VPC}}, and are enforced outside the EC2 instance, {{c1::blocking all inbound traffic}} by default and authorizing all outbound traffic."
"EC2 7": "{{c1::22}} for {{c1::SSH}}, {{c1::21}} for {{c1::FTP}}, {{c1::22}} for {{c1::SFTP}}, {{c1::80}} for {{c1::HTTP}}, {{c1::443}} for {{c10::HTTPS}}, and {{c11::3389}} for {{c12::RDP}} are the classic ports to be aware of for various network services and protocols."
"EC2 8": "Provides a browser-based interface to connect to EC2 instances without needing the key file downloaded initially. It relies on a {{c1::temporary key}} uploaded by AWS, primarily compatible with {{c1::Amazon Linux 2}}, and requires that port {{c1::22}} is open."
"EC2 9": "EC2 offers various purchasing options with different pricing models and commitment levels, including {{c1::On-Demand Instances}}, {{c1::Reserved Instances}}, {{c1::Savings Plans}}, {{c1::Spot Instances}}, {{c1::Dedicated Hosts}}, {{c1::Dedicated Instances}}, and {{c1::Capacity Reservations}}."
"EC2 10": "Offers the {{c1::highest cost flexibility}} with no upfront payment and no long-term commitment. Billing is per second for {{c1::Linux}} or {{c1::Windows}} (after the first minute) and per hour for other operating systems, recommended for {{c1::short-term}} and uninterrupted workloads."
"EC2 11": "Provide up to a {{c1::72% discount}} compared to {{c1::On-Demand pricing}}, with options for {{c1::1 or 3-year commitments}} and various payment options. Instances can be reserved {{c1::regionally}} or {{c1::zonally}} and are recommended for {{c1::steady-state usage}} applications."
"EC2 12": "Offer {{c1::discounts}} for long-term usage with commitment to a certain type of usage, flexible across {{c1::instance size}}, {{c1::OS}}, and {{c1::tenancy}} within a specific {{c1::family}} and {{c1::region}}."
"EC2 13": "Provide a discount of up to {{c1::90%}} compared to {{c1::On-Demand}}, suitable for workloads that are {{c1::resilient to failure}} and have flexible start and end times. These instances can be interrupted if the {{c1::spot price}} exceeds the bid."
"EC2 14": "Are {{c1::physical servers}} with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use, allowing you to address {{c1::compliance requirements}} and use existing server-bound software licenses, with purchasing options including {{c1::On-demand}} and {{c1::Reserved}}."
"EC2 15": "Run on hardware {{c1::dedicated}} to you and may share hardware with other instances in the same account, with no control over {{c1::instance placement}}."
"EC2 16": "Allow you to {{c1::reserve On-Demand instance capacity}} in a specific {{c1::AZ}} for any duration, with no time commitment but charged at {{c1::On-Demand rates}} whether you run instances or not."
"EC2 17": "On-Demand is like coming and staying in a resort whenever we like, paying the full price. Reserved is like planning ahead for a long stay to get a discount. Savings Plans is paying a certain amount per hour for a certain period and staying in any room type. Spot Instances are like bidding for empty rooms, where you can get kicked out at any time. Dedicated Hosts are booking an entire building of the resort. Capacity Reservations are booking a room for a period at full price even if you donâ€™t stay in it."
"EC2 18": "On-Demand: ${{c1::0.10}} per hour, Spot Instance: ${{c1::0.038-$0.039}} (up to {{c1::61% off}}), Reserved Instance (1 year): ${{c1::0.062}} (No Upfront) - ${{c1::0.058}} (All Upfront), Reserved Instance (3 years): ${{c1::0.043}} (No Upfront) - ${{c1::0.037}} (All Upfront), EC2 Savings Plan (1 year): ${{c1::0.062}} (No Upfront) - ${{c1::0.058}} (All Upfront), Reserved Convertible Instance (1 year): ${{c10::0.071}} (No Upfront) - ${{c11::0.066}} (All Upfront), Dedicated Hosts and Capacity Reservations: {{c12::On-Demand Price}}."
"EC2 19": "Amazon EC2's {{c1::Auto Scaling}} feature ensures that you maintain application availability and allows you to scale your {{c1::Amazon EC2}} capacity up or down automatically according to conditions you define."
"EC2 20": "With Amazon EC2, you can launch different types of {{c1::instances}} from a single {{c1::AMI}}. An instance type essentially determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance."
